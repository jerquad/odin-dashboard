# odin-dashboard

Created for the intermediate html/css course in The Odin Project. The objective is to emulate the stylization of a "user dashboard" with a primary emphasis on utilizing the grid layout system to create a dynamically laid out website.  Secondary goals include employing different style techniques covered in the course as well as a bit of cross utilization of flexbox.
